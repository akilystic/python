# python
This repo contains all my python codes.


file name : zero.py
This python code removes all the Zero columns in a matrix. The matrix is in the form of a nested list.
I have used the following approach:
1) Considering the matrix only contains positive values, I have summed all the columns and stored the values in another list.
2) Fetched the indices on the 0 values in the sum matrix.
3) Deleted the columns in the main list corresponding to the indices in the index list
